# presentations: An open-source repository of my slides! :tada:
This repository contains slides for my presentations, which are created using 
[manim-slides](https://github.com/jeertmans/manim-slides) and my personal extension called 
[manim-beamer](https://github.com/johnHostetter/manim-beamer). Some slides may even utilize 
[manim-timeline](https://github.com/johnHostetter/manim-timeline) for a more interactive experience 
illustrating the history of a particular field of study. I hope that by sharing these slides,
I can inspire others to create their own presentations using these tools and share their knowledge 
with the world! :earth_americas:
